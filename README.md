# Spatial and Temporal comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in relation with public health measures 
-----------------------
Description of the Project:

Objective of the project is to do a Spatial and Temporal comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in relation with public health measures implemented by different  countries.

In this project we want to determine the dynamic of the COVID-19 outbreak comparing to the the effective measures taken by some countries during the fight against it. For this study, majority of the European countries taken and few non-European countries that show unussual dynamics for the time being.
Information about the preventive measures implemented by countries of our selection, collected from reliable sources such as WHO, ministries and  reliable media within individual country etc.
Time series data provided by John Hopkins University "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" retrieved from the GitHub (free code sharing platform) source, the data contains worldwide records for COVID-19. 
Data treatment and visualizations were performed using Python whereby multiple scripts created to manipulate the dataframe comprised of different countries. Finally, multiple real time graphs produced for interpretation and analysis.

# Tools & techniques applicable for the project:
   -Time series data analysis and manipulation.
   -Statistical analysis, data treatment and Automation
   -Python scripting: Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib libraries.
   -Manipulation of Panda dataframes, data smoothing and fitting
   -Jupyter Notebook work environment
   -GitHub &/ or Git
   -Research exploring and writing skills

# Spatial and Temporal comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in relation to public health measures 
-----------------------
Description of the Project:

The objective of this project is to give the insight about the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic through spatial and temporal comparison of its dynamics with regard to public health measures implemented by different countries.

In this project we want to determine the dynamic of the COVID-19 outbreak comparing to the the effective measures taken by some countries during the fight against it. For this study, we selected European countries and few non-European countries that show unussual dynamics for the time being.
Information about the preventive measures implemented by countries of our selection, collected from reliable sources such as WHO, ministries and  reliable media within individual country etc.
Time series live data provided by John Hopkins University "https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" retrieved from the GitHub, the data contains worldwide records for COVID-19. 
Data treatment and visualizations were performed using Python to finally produce the results for interpretation and analysis.

# Tools & techniques applicable for the project:
   -Time series data analysis and manipulation.
   -Statistical analysis, data treatment and Automation
   -Python scripting: Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib libraries.
   -Manipulation of Panda dataframes, data smoothing and fitting
   - regression and fitting
